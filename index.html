        Addendum: This page includes a Holy Grail Layout using CSS grid. The JavaScript section provides an interactive experience where clicking the "Change Color" button dynamically alters the background color of the main content area. The JavaScript code responsible for this behavior is in a separate file named script.js.

        <br><br>

        <strong>Problem:</strong> The objective was to create a simple interaction to showcase the integration of JavaScript into the webpage, allowing users to experience dynamic changes on the page.

        <br><br>

        <strong>Solution:</strong> I achieved this by implementing a button that, when clicked, triggers a JavaScript function to change the background color of the main content area. The color is randomly generated using a function that creates a hexadecimal color code.

        <br><br>

        <strong>Challenges:</strong> While the overall task was straightforward, one challenge was ensuring a visually pleasing color transition. Careful consideration was given to generate a wide range of colors to enhance the user experience.

        <br><br>

        <strong>Further Improvements:</strong> Future enhancements could involve refining the color generation algorithm, adding smooth transitions between colors, or incorporating user preferences for a more personalized experience.

        <br><br>

        Overall, this exercise provided hands-on experience in combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and visually dynamic web page.
